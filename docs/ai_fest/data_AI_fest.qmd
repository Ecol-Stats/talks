## Monitoring species distributions {background-image="city_plan.gif"}

> Imagine planning a city without knowing where people live. This is exactly what we risk doing in conservation if we don't accurately map where species exist---and why.

## Monitoring species distributions

::::: columns

-   Biodiversity monitoring programs have become essential to **understand** the spatial distribution of species.

-   The analysis of species distribution data is **challenging**

## The Challenge of Data

-   The information available for species distributions models is radically changing

-   New opportunities for surveying wildlife in space and time.

## The Challenge of Data {.smaller}

::: {style="height: 50px;"}
:::

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   As the **volume** of recorded ecological data continues to grow, so does the need for **computationally efficient methods** for answering complex ecological questions.
    -   What are the environmental drivers of species distributions?
    -   Whats is the impact that human activities have on biodiversity?
    -   Can we predict how species distribution and biodiversity will be affected by climate change?

## Planned Survey Data {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

For many years, **structured data** has been the one on the most important sources of information used by researchers to analyse species distributions.

-   **Structured data** involves constant monitoring schemes using standardised methods at sites on a regular basis.

For many years, **structured data** has been the one on the most important sources of information used by researchers to analyse species distributions.

-   **Structured data** involves constant monitoring schemes using standardised methods at sites on a regular basis.

-   These are **expensive** to collect and tend to be geographically and temporally restricted.

## Citizen Science **Unstructured** Data {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

**Unstructured data** constitute the majority of available information nowadays.

-   **Citizen science** projects offer a cost-effective solution to investigate species distributions at large spatial and temporal scales.

-   **Citizen science** projects offer a cost-effective solution to investigate species distributions at large spatial and temporal scales.
-   Harnessing the power of CS data is not an easy task!

| Advantages 😄👍 | Disadvantages 😔👎 |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Extensive taxonomic, spatial and temporal coverage. | Under-reporting of rare and inconspicuous species. |
| Eye-catching species that are easily identifiable by participants. | Varying recording skills and uneven sampling effort. |

## Sampling Bias in CS opportunistic data {.smaller}

Large volumes of CS data come from **Opportunistic surveys** where sampling effort is **biased** across space and time.

-   People visit more certain places than others.

![Elevation versus sampling effort (obtained through the Pl\@net Net App) in the French mediterranean region.](images/sampling_eff_ex.png){fig-align="center"}

::: incremental
-   Small populations at lower elevation could be over-sampled.

-   If we assume sampling is evenly distributed, species occupancy at higher elevation would be under-estimated
:::

## Correcting for sampling bias

-   The true locations where a species occur are a realization of a continuous spatial process that describe the density of the occurrences.

-   The true locations where a species occur are a realization of a continuous spatial process that describe the density of the occurrences.

-   The true point pattern is partially observed due to **accessibility constrains** reflected by an uneven sampling effort.

## Case Study: Modelling the Distribution of the black-throated blue warbler in Pennsylvania, USA. {.smaller}

-   Occurrence data for the Black-throated blue warbler (*Setophaga caerulescens*) in Pennsylvania, USA are available from:

-   Observations reported by citizen scientists to the **eBird** platform in 2008.

-   `eBird` citizen science data are usually biased due to **uneven sampling effort**.
